<h1>Syllabus for SWE 622 - Distributed Software Engineering - Fall 2017</h1>

<p>
<h1>What is this course?</h1>
<p>
This course conveys key 
concepts for designing and building distributed software systems.&nbsp; 
The course is geared towards software engineers that work mostly at the 
application-level, but need to understand the features and limitations 
of existing middleware for distributed systems.&nbsp; Additionally, the 
course covers some research topics related to currently open 
problems.&nbsp;Specifically, some of the topic that will be covered are 
as follows: definition and scope of distribution, principles of 
communication and computation, socket programming, remote method 
invocation, software architecture of distributed systems, middleware 
systems, service discovery, quality of service, adaptive systems, 
mobility, security, and fault tolerance.

<b>Please read this syllabus</b>.  I like the Morphus image saying,
<a href="https://imgflip.com/i/btlqz">What if I told you...
the answer is in the syllabus?</a>
Please <b>read</b> the syllabus before asking questions about the course,
and certainly before missing a deadline... it will save us all time.

<p>
The syllabus, including the schedule and topics to be covered,
is subject to change, but I will notify you of any changes.
This class is based on the structure set up by Dr. Sam Malek, with
some changes by Dr. Paul Ammann;
you'll see their name or URLs pointing to their sites occasionally.

<p>
<a name="Reading List"></a>
<h1>Reading List</h1>
<p>
The textbook is
<i>Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms (2nd edition)</i>, Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten Van Steen, 2007/2016, ISBN 0-13-239227-5.
Either the hardback or paperback is fine.
You can <a href="https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/distributed-systems/">get a free personal digital copy of the second edition</a> if
you send the authors your email address.
Beware: There's also a <i>third</i> edition that was released in 2017;
we're <i>not</i> using that edition.
See below for supplemental papers.
<p>
I may add a few additional required reading articles as we go.
<p>
The book is fine for fundamentals, but
we will supplement it with some key additions.
This includes discussions of REST,
Blockchains (including Bitcoin), and Apache Hadoop and Spark.

<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Five Reading Assignments  20% (5 x 4%)
<li>Two Programming Assignments 30% (2 x 15%)
<li>Two Exams 48% (2 x 24%)
<li>Hadoop/Spark online quiz (2%)
</ol>
<!--
Assignment focus:
RA1: 1
RA2: 2,3
RA3: 4,5
RA4: 6,7
RA5: 8,9
Hadoop: 10
Prog1: 2
Prog2: 3
-->
<p>
The exams are closed book, closed notes (no access to either), no Internet.
You <i>may</i> bring a numeric-only calculator
(one with a log function is convenient), but <i>not</i> one which
can store texts or has Internet access.
<p>
The reading assignments are group assignments, with open book,
open notes, and open Internet.
I want groups of 4, though some variation is possible.
List your group members in your submission.
Groups do not have to have the same membership each time
(though they often do, and that's fine too).
Everyone must <i>contribute</i> to the group.
It's an honor code violation if someone OUTSIDE the group does your work.
If there is disagreement, work to figure out the cause, so that
you can produce better answers.
For example, some answers may vary depending on certain factors;
your group must figure out what factors the answer depends on.
<p>
The programming assignments are individual assignments;
you must do your own work.
<p>
Assignments must be submitted via Blackboard unless otherwise warranted.
For group assignments (the reading assignments) only one team member
needs to submit.
I typically use tools to check for plagerism; please don't plagerize.
Do not turn them in late; penalty is -10% per day, and not accepted after
three days.
Students must give me notice as soon as reasonably possible if an
illness or other unexpected event will make it impossible to submit work
or take a test on time.
<p>
I grade on results, not effort.
Please don't tell me "I worked so hard" as a reason to improve your grade;
I presume everyone in the class works hard, and it's not fair to improve
your grade if others produced better results.

<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>

<p>
The lectures will cover the key issues and
explain some things that might not be clear otherwise.
However, you are responsible for reading and understanding the material
in the assigned readings (and not just knowing what&#8217;s in the lectures).

<p>
The date for finals has a slightly different time (7:30 pm - 10:15 pm);
please hold that date in case we need it.
See the
<a href="http://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/">GMU calendar</a>
for general information on the GMU calendar.
I routinely check the list of
<a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/calendar/religious-holiday-calendar/">&#8221;non-work&#8221;
religious holidays</a> maintained by GMU.

<h1>Other information</h1>
<p>
In class, please pay attention and <i>don&#8217;t distract others</i>.
Please configure cell phones to vibrate (and not make noise) in class.
<p>
Please talk to me ahead-of-time if you have an anticipated absence that will
interfere with the mid-term or final exam,
e.g., a <a href="http://ulife.gmu.edu/religious_calendar.php">non-work religious holiday</a>,
out-of-town work travel, or GMU athletic meet.
Don&#8217;t bother telling me if you&#8217;ll miss other class times;
I strongly recommend class attendance, but I understand if
work, family, or other commitments sometimes make that difficult to do.
You can always turn in work early
(e.g., if a deadline conflicts with a religious holiday).

<h1>Important information for any GMU class</h1>
<p>
<h2>Academic Integrity (Honor Code)</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://oai.gmu.edu/">GMU is an Honor Code</a> university;
it's baked into the GMU culture.
<i>I take the honor code very seriously</i>.
<p>
It is expected that students adhere to the George Mason University
Honor Code as it relates to integrity regarding coursework and grades.
The Honor Code reads as follows: "To promote a stronger sense of mutual
responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the
George Mason University community and with the desire for greater
academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the
University Community have set forth this: Student members of the George
Mason University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal and/or
lie in matters related to academic work."  More information about the
Honor Code, including definitions of cheating, lying, and plagiarism, can
be found at the Office of Academic Integrity website at
<a href="http://oai.gmu.edu">http://oai.gmu.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
In particular, when you are responsible for a task, you
will perform that task. When you rely on someone else&#8217;s work in an
aspect of the performance of that task, you will give full credit in the
proper, accepted form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free
play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this
course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be
conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives,
and traditions.
When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance and clarification.
<b>Do not plagiarize, and do not enable others to plagiarize from you.</b>
<p>
Although students are encouraged to discuss the topics covered
in class, all homework assignments
(reading assignments), exams, and projects (programming assignments)
are to be
completed individually, unless joint work is explicitly authorized by
the instructor. If joint work is authorized, all contributing students
must be listed on the submission.
<p>
Failure to adhere to the honor code can result in a variety of sanctions,
including a zero on the assignment, an F in the course,
suspension, or expulsion from GMU.
Harsher sanctions are normal for graduate students; we expect at this
point that you know better.
<p>
See the
<a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/HonorCode/HomePage">Computer Science Honor Code policies</a> for more.

<p>
<h2>GMU Email Accounts</h2>
<p>
Please use the instructor&#8217;s email address for class questions.
You <i>must</i> use your Mason email account for all email correspondence
having anything to do with your work at Mason. Federal laws protecting
your privacy rights require that we only communicate student information
directly to students - and use of the university email system is our
only way to validate your identity on email. You may forward your campus
email elsewhere, but we can respond only to a Mason email account.

<p>
<h2>Office of Disability Services (ODS)</h2>
<p>
If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations,
it&#8217;s nice to let me know as a courtesy, but you must
contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at 703-993-2474 or
<a href="http://ods.gmu.edu">http://ods.gmu.edu</a>.
All academic accommodations <i>must</i> be arranged through the ODS,
not through me.
If you qualify for accommodation,
the ODS staff will give you a form detailing appropriate accommodations
for your instructor (me), please bring that <i>form</i> to me.
